#Title: Task Project in Django
#Author: Brian Casarrubias


#Usage: This web application was created to help visualize daily tasks. Here you write down what ever you want,
hover over the tasks, and click to mark down as completed or not completed. Once you do that, the items will dynamically update without having to
refresh the page. The way I've achieved this was with HTMX.
